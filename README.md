# Image_Classification_Problems_Among_Few_Samples

 1. Applied data augmentation, particle swarm optimization algorithm and SVM to complete the classification task.
 2. Developed DCGAN to generate new samples and proposed a feature-enhanced CNN to maximize the network’s ability to extract features among limited samples and classify them.
